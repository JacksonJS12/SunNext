# ☀️ SunNext – Smart Solar Energy Optimization Platform

**SunNext** is a B2B web platform designed to help solar park owners, energy storage managers, and traders **maximize profits from renewable energy** production.

It brings together **solar asset monitoring**, **simulations**, and **IBEX electricity market integration**. The platform uses a **centralized virtual battery system** and a **decoupled data API** to manage and optimize energy usage and trading.

## 🔍 Key Features

### ⚙️ Solar Asset Monitoring

* Manage solar systems (Grid-Tied, Off-Grid, Hybrid)
* Track real-time performance: generation, capacity, and efficiency
* Use built-in simulation engine for forecasting and analysis

### 🔋 Virtual Battery Wallet (Energy-as-Currency)

All energy generated by a user’s solar assets is routed into a **shared virtual wallet**:

* Modeled as a **battery collection**, decoupled from the grid
* Surplus energy is stored and shown as a **balance**
* This balance can later be **sold like cryptocurrency** on the energy market
* The energy is stored into batteries on one place
* The electricity travels through the grid into one place where it is stored
* Wallet capacity depends on user subscription plan (Small, Medium, Large)

### 📈 Smart Market Integration

* Fetches **daily IBEX Day-Ahead prices** automatically
* Calculates optimal hourly **trading targets** for each solar asset
* Visualizes actual vs. target prices using **Chart.js**
* Enables users to optimize profit by selling energy at peak hours

## 🛰 Powered by IBEX-Scraper-API

SunNext **does not scrape IBEX directly**:

> [`IBEX-Scraper-API`](https://github.com/JacksonJS12/IBEX-Scraper-API) – An ASP.NET Core Web API that scrapes **IBEX Day-Ahead segment prices** and stores them in a remote SQL Server database.

### 🧠 Why a Separate API?

* **Decouples scraping logic** from the main platform
* Ensures **secure**, **stable**, and **reusable** data access
* Makes it easy to extend to other platforms or external tools

### 🔄 How It Works:

* Scrapes **next-day hourly prices**
* Triggered daily at **14:00 BG time** via an **external scheduler** ([cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org))
* Calls `POST /api/Scrape/scrape-and-save` only if new data is available
* Stores data as:

  * `Date` (`dd/MM/yyyy`)
  * `Hour` (1–24 CET/EET/EEST)
  * `PricePerMWh`
